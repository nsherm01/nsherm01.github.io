                <p class="interest-paragraph">
                    I volunteer with an organization called Alpha Phi Omega. Every quarter, we partner 
                    with non-profit and local organizations in San Luis Obispo to make a positive impact 
                    on the community. From organizing charity events to participating in environmental cleanups, 
                    I've had the opportunity to contribute to a variety of meaningful projects. Serving as 
                    both Membership Vice President and Recruitment Chair, I've been actively involved in 
                    fostering a sense of community within our organization. Community service is important to 
                    me because it allows me to connect with diverse groups of people, make a tangible difference 
                    in the lives of others, and contribute to the well-being of the community that I call home. 
                    It's a fulfilling and rewarding experience that continuously inspires me to give back and 
                    create positive change.

                    Playing the guitar and ukulele is a passion of mine.
                    The process of practicing and honing my skills until I master a song is truly gratifying. 
                    This musical journey allows me to express myself creatively and brings me a sense of accomplishment.

                <p class="interest-paragraph">
                    Climbing is an intricate puzzle where every move requires thoughtful manipulation. 
                    I'm drawn to the challenge, the physicality, and the mental engagement it offers. 
                    Staying active is essential to my well-being, and climbing serves as the perfect outlet for me to 
                    push my limits and embrace the thrill of reaching new summits.

                <p class="interest-paragraph">
                    Crocheting is a cherished pastime for me, offering a tranquil escape to unwind and declutter my mind. 
                    The motion of the needle and yarn becomes a soothing ritual. I find immense joy in crafting crochet 
                    gifts for others, as each project is unique with care and thoughtfulness.

                    I am a board game nerd... I find great pleasure in the art of strategy, deduction, and delving into 
                    game theory. Among my favorite games are Mafia, Catan, and Poker, each offering a unique blend of 
                    challenges that keep my strategic mind engaged and offer the perfect night with friends.
