        <p class="sim-paragraph">
            I wanted to challenge myself by creating a simulation of natural selection. I was inspired by watching a YouTuber named Primer, who created a similar simulation. I wanted to create a simulation that was more interactive and visually appealing. I used the Unity game developer platform and C# scripts to create the simulation. The simulation is a 2D grid of squares, each representing an organism. The organisms have different traits, such as speed, size, and color. The organisms move around the grid, eating food and reproducing. The simulation is designed to show how different traits affect an organism's survival and reproduction. I hope to expand the simulation in the future to include more complex behaviors and interactions between organisms.
        </p>
        <p class="sim-paragraph">
            The simulation is still a work in progress, but I have made significant progress in creating the basic framework and functionality. I have implemented the grid, organisms, food, and basic movement and reproduction mechanics. I am currently working on adding more traits and behaviors to the organisms, as well as improving the visual appearance of the simulation. I am excited to continue working on the project and see how far I can take it.
