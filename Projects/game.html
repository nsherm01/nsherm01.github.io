<h3 class="wordle-header">About Farm Rush:</h3>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
The goal of Farm Rush is to defend the sheep on your farm for all 8 waves and to have as many sheep alive as possible at the end of your game. Your sheep have been slowly disappearing at night time and you vow to never let another sheep go missing to these savage predators again. In this game, you control a farmer player seeking to eliminate enemies trying to eat your sheep. Enemies come in waves of increasing difficulty (bringing both an increased number of enemies and stronger enemies), with a total of 8 waves. When enemies are defeated, they drop coins. Your chicken sidekick will help collect the coins for you. In between waves, the user is prompted with a shop screen to use their collected coins to purchase stronger weapons and placeable defenses that can be used to defend the farm better. These strategic selections made during the purchasing and placement round are where the player will experience meaningful choices and develop their own strategy for defending their farm.

The user controls the player with the WASD keys, allowing them to move along the farm in the X- and Z-axis directions. The player also holds a weapon. The user uses their mouse to point the weapon in the direction they want to aim. The user can then right-click the mouse button to fire the weapon. The user can also press “R” to reload the weapon. The defense placement system can be accessed with the “I” key and the “esc” key is used to exit it. During the defense placement period, players cannot access their usual controls. Instead, they can select the area on the playable field by clicking with the left mouse button, which finalizes the placement process. Right-click allows for rotation of the defenses.

<h3 class="wordle-header">Designing Farm Rush:</h3>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
We designed Farm Rush to have meaningful play through game narrative, gameplay, and game rules.
</p>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
Game Narrative:
</p>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
The narrative of Farm Rush plays an important part in immersing the player in our game. The player is a farmer who is determined to protect his sheep from the dangerous threat of wolves who come out at night. The player must become stronger as the wolves continue to come with more force. 
We establish and reinforce this narrative through several design choices. The background terrain is designed to be a grassy field where sheep reside. As the player explores the field's borders, they will find barn-like structures and trees like you would find on a farm. We also developed a day and night cycle. At the start of each wave of enemies, the lighting fades to dark, suggesting nighttime when the wolves appear. After the wave ends, the light brightens to daytime, suggesting the player successfully defended another night of the wolf onslaught. We also designed the user interface to be rustic and serious, indicating that the player is in a serious situation to defend their valuable sheep. The narrative provides context and meaning for the player and emotionally ties them to the game's goal.

Game Play:
</p>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
We developed many techniques in our game to create enjoyable gameplay. One of the most important features of our game is player choice. This is done through the player shop. At the end of every round, the player has the option to spend their hard earned coins for better weapons, defenses, or more lives. By giving the player the choice of how they want to spend their money, it allows the user to develop and own their personal strategy for the game. It also allows for emergent gameplay, as the player will discover strategies that may prove more effective than others. 
We can narrow the player choice even further by looking at weapon design. Every weapon has a camera view associated with it. For example, the sniper rifle has an expanded view of the map, while the shotgun has a narrowed view of the map. This is to simulate the range of the weapons in real life. It also helped address meaningful play issues with the weapons. We value meaningful play in purchase decisions, so we didn’t want one weapon to be too overpowerful. To address this, all weapons have a trade-off. While the sniper has a large camera view, it has a slow fire rate. Similarly, the shotgun has a narrowed view but a faster fire rate. 
Another important aspect of meaningful gameplay is sound design. Sounds help further immerse the player into the game and heighten tension, success, and failure. One critical use of sound is the background music. The music is upbeat and intense, and it adds to the overall emotional connection the player has with the game. We also effectively used sound effects. When the first level loads, the player hears a wolf howl, indicating the start of the round. This helps launch the player into their “fight or flight” mode and raise adrenaline. We also have "juiciness" sound effects, such as button clicking and purchase sounds. When the player presses buttons in either the home menu, pause menu, or shop, a “click” sound is made. This subtle game design detail makes the game satisfying to play. When a purchase is made, a “ca-ching” sound is made to subtly reward and reiterate that the player should be making purchases in the game. These minor enhancements with sound design are large contributors to good game play for the player.
We also tried to follow a general trend in our pacing of our game, which loosely follows a linearly increasing tension. Each wave increases in difficulty and so the game becomes progressively more intense the further the player is. With each wave increasing in intensity, we decided to implement cooling periods between waves. This serves to allow the player a chance to relax and prepare for the incoming wave. We have the phases of the game done visually with a day and night cycle. The enemies will spawn during the night, indicated by a sound cue as well as the overall lighting turning darker. The daytime is represented by a more intense light. We also activate the buttons during the day for the shop, inventory, and next wave. We thought of this pacing early on and worked out a solution that we think visually tells the pacing of our game.

Game Rules:
</p>
<p class="wordle-paragraph">
We established operational rules, constitutive rules, and implicit rules that are fundamental to understanding how Farm Rush operates and how the player interacts within its framework. Operational rules are explicit rules that dictate the mechanics of the game. In Farm Rush, the operational rules are the player controls such as movement and weapon firing, coin collection, and purchasing items in the shop. Constitutive rules define the overall objective of the game, guiding the players decision making and purpose. In Farm Rush, the constitutive rules are to defend your sheep from the hungry wolves for all 6 rounds and keep as many sheep alive as possible. Implicit rules not formally defined but rather inferred through gameplay. In Farm Rush, the implicit rules are to upgrade your weapons and place defenses to protect your sheep. 
Our game has elements of both a progressive game structure and an emergent game structure. It is a progressive structure in the sense that the player starts off with a weak pistol and faces just one enemy in the first round. Progressively, the player becomes stronger as the waves of enemies become more difficult too. However, the game has elements of emergence structure because the player has to decide what upgrades, defenses, or sheep to buy. This leads to varied and unpredictable gameplay.
Farm Rush is a game of imperfect information rather than perfect information. The player does not know how difficult each wave of enemies will be until they encounter it. Furthermore, the player gets some idea of the weapons and defenses in the shop, but it is not entirely clear. Another example of imperfect information is that the player knows there is another wave of enemies, but they are unsure what challenges it will bring. The waves are static, so after multiple playthroughs the player is able to tell which enemies come in which wave. The player can also tell damage and enemy health from multiple runs, as the damages and healths are static. Initially the game has imperfect information but there is a way to extract data on stats. Having imperfect information creates more depth to the game as the user has to strategize how to navigate complex decisions. 
We also incorporate probability into our game. Enemies spawn in a radius from the center of the field. Every time an enemy spawns, there’s an equally likely chance it will spawn in any direction. This means the player must strategize a way to defend the farm equally against the randomly spawning enemies. This is done by randomly generating a point on a circle of that radius and spawning the enemies on that point
We also have a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop is like an “avalanche” effect. If the player is doing well, it is easier to stay ahead. If the player is doing poorly, they will have a difficult time keeping up with the game. In Farm Rush, if a wolf attacks the player’s sheep, they both lose a life and do not receive money for defeating the wolf. When the player receives less money each round, they have less money to spend on weapons and defenses, making it more likely that sheep will be eaten. Similarly, if the player is performing well and not losing any lives, they have more money to purchase strong weapons and defenses and further protect their sheep. Feedback loops are important to keep the player's engagement and satisfaction up while providing a reward system.
