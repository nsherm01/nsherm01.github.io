        <p class="sp-paragraph">
            I am currently in my final quarter at University, where I am working on my Final Project. The goal is to recreate an "Acoustic Side-Channel Attack", a technique used by Cold War-era Soviet spies to eavesdrop on typrewriter keystrokes. By listening to the sound of typing on a keyboard, I am able to reconstruct the text being typed in real-time. This project combines my interests in cybersecurity and deep learning.
        </p>
        <p class="sp-paragraph">
This project is still a work in progress, but I have made significant progress in developing the deep learning model and the audio processing pipeline. I am currently working on improving the accuracy of the model and optimizing the real-time performance. I am excited to continue working on the project and see how far I can take it.
