            This program is an intelligent engine designed to solve the popular word puzzle game, Wordle. 
            The aim is to guess the correct five-letter word within the least number of attempts.

            How It Works Initial Guess: The engine starts with a wide library of five-letter words. 
            Feedback Analysis: After each guess, the game's feedback is used to prune the word library, 
            eliminating words that no longer fit the given clues. Next Guesses: Using a refined list, 
            the engine makes subsequent guesses that are more informed and targeted. Solution Path: 
            The decision tree within the program visualizes the process of narrowing down the word 
            library until the correct word is found.

            Features Efficient Algorithm: Designed to reach the correct answer in the fewest guesses possible. 
            Feedback Integration: Dynamically updates the possible answers based on the game's colored tile feedback. 
            GUI of Decision Process: Provides a clear representation of the guessing process and the next choice of words.
